    this project is dedicated to the memory of the worst and dumbest president
    in history but also the best Twitter user ever to walk the earth. we will
    never see a poster as evil, as petty, and as unimaginatively spitful as he
    was. RIP @realDonaldTrump, long live @realDonaldTrump.

    oh yeah, also hire me plz

            I hope everyone remembers when they’re getting the COVID-19 (often referred to as
            the China Virus) Vaccine, that if I wasn’t President, you wouldn’t be getting that
            beautiful "shot" for 5 years, at best, and probably wouldn’t be getting it at all.
            I hope everyone remembers!
